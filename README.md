# Amazon clone built using HTML and CSS

This webpage is responsive, but, best viewed in screens that are **1920px** wide.

From what I understand, Amazon's actual website does not make use of _CSS media queries_ to make their site responsive. Instead, they implement either a different stylesheet, or a different page with a different stylesheet for smaller viewports.
Coding another stylesheet is a lot of extra work. _Maybe_ I'll do it sometime in the future.

For now, I opted to make my clone responsive using basic flex wrapping. It does not look great, but it serves the purpose.
I have also been implementing fixes and introducing further polish to this clone every now and then.
