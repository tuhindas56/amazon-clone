# Amazon clone built using HTML and CSS

This webpage is responsive, but, best viewed in screens that are **1920px** wide.

From what I understand, Amazon's actual website does not make use of _CSS media queries_ to make their site responsive. Instead, they serve either a different stylesheet, or a different page with a different stylesheet for smaller viewports.
Initially, I was looking to approach this in a similar fashion. But that seemed like extra work.
I might do that or implement media queries later down the line.
For now, I've opted to make my clone responsive using basic flex wrapping. It does not look great, but it no longer looks like the disaster it initially was.

I am also implementing fixes and introducing further polish to this clone every now and then.
